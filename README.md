# Reinforcement-learning-introductionn

This project is an assignment from the Machine Learning Specialization - Andrew Ng Course, focused on training an agent using Deep Q-Learning to safely land a Lunar Lander in the OpenAI Gym environment. The project involves implementing Experience Replay and Target Networks to stabilize training. The goal is to develop an agent capable of landing on a designated landing pad using reinforcement learning techniques. Students apply Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms to train and evaluate the agent's performance.
